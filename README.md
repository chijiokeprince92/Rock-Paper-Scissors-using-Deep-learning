# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS USING DEEP LEARNING

This model uses deep learning to predict the outcome of a rock paper scissors game. The model is trained on a dataset of images of rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures. The model then uses this data after image augmentation has been performed, to learn the different features of each gesture. When a new image is presented to the model, the model predicts the most likely gesture.

The model is able to achieve a high accuracy rate, even when the images are of poor quality. This makes the model suitable for a variety of applications, such as online games, gambling, and security systems.

Here are some of the benefits of using a deep learning model to predict the rock paper scissors game:

* **High accuracy:** The model is able to achieve a high accuracy rate, even when the images are of poor quality.
* **Scalability:** The model can be easily scaled to handle large datasets.
* **Flexibility:** The model can be used for a variety of applications.

The dataset was gotten from https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/rock_paper_scissors

Future update of this notebook will include making it two players compactible and using your webcam for playing
